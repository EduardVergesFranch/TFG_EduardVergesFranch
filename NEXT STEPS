NEXTS STEPS

1-> Obtaian a numerical evaluation of the current pysimmusic software.
	- Measure how the onset detection works
	- Measure how pitch classes detection works


	-> AFTER MEETING WITH SEVA (10/03/2021)
		- concentrate on Pitch Detection
		- Two kinds of metrics possible:
			- Note Event-wise pitch class sets comparisons (see Bay et al. (2009) ) + CONFUSION MATRIX (1 FOCUS ON THIS)
			- FRAME WISE evaluation ( same approach but instead of note event-wise do it frame wise and weight durations )
			
1 b - > (Understand Training process)
2-> Using the 6 new songs I transcribed (Guitar Grade 0)
	- Perform data augmentation:
		. Recording by my self
		. Impulse response simmulation different rooms.
		. Apply random noises ... (randomness)
		. Same songs recorded faster!
		
3- > Compare how different training datasets influentiate the results (The objective is to obtain a perfect transcription for the GT/Ideal performances)
	- Kind of Cross-Validation!
